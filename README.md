# PIE Token Project

## Description

PIE Token is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency utilizing the Binance Smart Chain (BNB Test) to generate liquidity through operations such as minting, burning, and transactions. This project seamlessly integrates with the Metamask digital wallet, providing users with a secure and efficient transaction experience.

## Features

- **Mint and Burn:** Users can create new tokens (mint) and destroy existing tokens (burn), thus controlling the supply of the PIE Token.

- **Transactions:** The project facilitates transactions between users, promoting the movement of the token on the BNB Test network.

- **Metamask Integration:** Integration with the Metamask wallet offers an additional layer of security and convenience, allowing users to manage their private keys securely.

## Next Steps (TODO)

- **Next.js Landing Page:** Add a Landing Page developed in Next.js to provide information about the project, usage instructions, and details about the PIE Token.

- **Micro Wallet:** Implement a micro wallet within the project to enable users to perform basic operations directly within the interface, eliminating the need to access Metamask separately.
